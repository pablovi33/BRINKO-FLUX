# Brinko Flux

**Brinko Flux** is an open modular construction system focused on **3D-printed RC vehicles, robotics, and mechanical experimentation**.

It is designed for makers who want:
- a reusable system of parts
- clear documentation
- open files
- and optional physical kits to save time

Brinko Flux is not a single model — it is a **platform**.

---

## What is Brinko Flux?

Brinko Flux is built around a simple idea:

> **Design parts once. Reuse them across many projects.**

Instead of creating isolated models, Brinko Flux defines:
- a shared system of mechanical parts
- compatible electronics
- and repeatable assembly logic

This allows multiple vehicles and machines to evolve from the same foundation.

---

## What can you build?

Current and planned projects include:
- RC cars
- tractors
- experimental vehicles
- robotics platforms

Each project is defined by:
- a Bill of Materials (BOM)
- a small set of project-specific parts
- assembly documentation
- a firmware profile (when applicable)

---


## Open & Modular by Design

Brinko Flux is intentionally open:
- STL files are free to download
- assembly manuals are public
- firmware is open source

You are free to:
- print parts
- modify designs
- build your own variants
- learn from the system

## Kits & Accessories

For builders who want a faster or more reliable experience, optional kits are available:
- Electronic Core Kits (pre-configured controller and electronics)
- Physical kits (printed parts + electronics)
- Premium digital content (car bodies, variants, bundles)

All kits are optional.  
The platform remains fully usable without them.

👉 Kits and upgrades are available via Ko-fi.

## Documentation

Start here:
- Assembly manuals
- BOMs
- Electronics guides
- Firmware information

📘 Documentation is available in the Wiki.

---

## Who is this for?

Brinko Flux is designed for:
- makers with a 3D printer
- educators and students
- RC hobbyists
- people who enjoy building and understanding systems

It is **not a toy** and is recommended for ages **15+**.

---

## Philosophy

Brinko Flux values:
- clarity over complexity
- reuse over one-off parts
- openness over lock-in
- learning through building

If you want a polished consumer product, this may not be for you.  
If you want a system you can grow with, you are in the right place.
